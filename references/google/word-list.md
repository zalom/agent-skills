This word list covers style and usage guidelines specific to developer documentation. If a term isn't listed here, check other editorial resources, including the preferred dictionary, Merriam-Webster. If Merriam-Webster lists multiple spellings, use the first form listed (the most common spelling) — e.g., for *cancel*, the first listed past tense is *canceled*, so that's more common than *cancelled*.

For technical definitions, check the authoritative documentation on the topic. Terminology decisions (how/when to define or contextualize terms) require judgment based on product area, audience, and prevailing convention. Related pages: Jargon, Inclusive language, Write for a global audience, Hyphens, Capitalization. It's fine to deviate from this guidance if it serves readers better (see Break the rules).

## Label definitions

- **Use with caution** — avoid the term when possible, or use with caution. The term might be ambiguous or obscure; alternative suggestions are provided, or use a more specific term. You can use the term if needed — define it or use it only once (see Jargon).
- **Don't use** — in all cases, prefer not to use the term. The term might be particularly ambiguous or have an offensive/non-inclusive association. If the term appears in code, replace or write around it.
- **Android** — applies only to Android documentation.
- **Google Cloud** — applies only to Google Cloud documentation.
- **Google Workspace** — applies only to Google Workspace documentation.

- **beta** — Lowercase except when part of a product name. Recommended: PRODUCT_NAME Beta Recommended: PRODUCT_NAME is currently in beta.
- **between versus among** — It's fine to use *between* when talking about more than two things; however, *between* isn't interchangeable with *among*.

Use *among* when you're talking about things that are part of a group or things that aren't distinct: Recommended: ... a conventional SQL database that can be shared among multiple apps. More examples: Recommended: Because screen dimensions vary widely among devices (for example, between phones and tablets, and even among different phones), you should configure the viewport so that your pages render correctly on many different devices. Not recommended: Because screen dimensions vary widely between devices (for example, between phones and tablets, and even between different phones), you should configure the viewport so that your pages render correctly on many different devices.

- **blacklist, black list, black-list** — Don't use *blacklist*, *whitelist*, and *graylist*. Instead, use more precise terms that are appropriate for your domain. For the noun *blacklist*, consider using a replacement such as *denylist*, *excludelist*, or *blocklist*. For the noun *whitelist*, consider using a replacement such as *allowlist*, *trustlist*, or *safelist*. For the noun *graylist* (*greylist*), consider using a replacement such as *provisional list*. In all of these cases, consider that there might not actually be a list involved. When replacing problematic terms, be sure to be technically accurate for the specific context. For the verb forms of these words, a simple word-for-word replacement typically isn't the best solution. Instead, replace verbs such as *blacklisted* with phrases that accurately convey the relevant action. For example: Recommended: To deny requests from an IP address, add it to the dos.yaml file. Not recommended: To denylist an IP address, add it to the dos.yaml file. Don't use: To blacklist an IP address, add it to the dos.yaml file. If the command or code that you're documenting uses one of these words, then use the words only in direct reference to the code items (formatted as code), and make it clear what you're referring to. Recommended: Add a user to the allowlist (whitelist) by entering the following: whitelist adduser EMAIL_ADDRESS.

Although it is difficult to measure happiness precisely, SRE uses service level indicators (SLIs) to quantify user perception. For example, a customer might feel a "need" to watch a show on TV. If the show is available, the customer's need is satisfied. But if playback is slow or choppy, the customer might not be happy. For more information about SRE and measuring reliability, see The Happiness Test.

Use *hotspot* and *hotspots* as nouns. Don't use verb and gerund forms such as *hotspotting*, because they translate less consistently. When you use *hotspot*, define it the first time that you use it on a page as you normally do with jargon. Recommended: Hotspots in one table can affect the performance of other tables.

If you must use *new*, give the reader a reference point&mdash;for example, a version number or release date. Don't use *newer* to refer to a specific version of a product. Instead, use *later*. Make sure that you provide a version number or release date by which to understand *later*. In Android documentation, use *higher* instead of *later*.
