Use sentence case for headings and titles. Use descriptive headings and titles because they help a reader navigate their browser and the page. It's easier to jump between pages and sections of a page if the headings and titles are unique.

## Heading and title text

Write document titles based on the primary purpose of the document. If a document is primarily a tutorial, but it has a conceptual introduction, write a task-based title. Write section headings based on the type of content that's in the section.

### Guidance

| | Guidance | Recommended | Not recommended |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Task-based heading** | For a task-based heading, start with a bare infinitive, also known as a _plain form_ or base form verb. In English, the _imperative mood_ also uses the base form verb, so it looks the same as the bare infinitive. Task-based headings are frequently used in quickstarts, how-to documents, and tutorials. | Create an instance | Creating an instance |
| **Conceptual heading** | For a conceptual or non-task-based heading, use a noun phrase that doesn't start with an _-ing_ verb. Noun-phrase headings are frequently used in concept documentation. | Migration to Google Cloud | Migrating to Google Cloud |
| **Optional sections** | If a section is not required for all users or scenarios, use the _Optional:_ prefix in the heading. This prefix signals when the section information applies only to a specific configuration or use case. For information about optional steps in a procedure, see Optional steps in Procedures. | Optional: Customize your alias | Customize your alias (optional) |

### Title phrasing

Use a unique level-1 heading (`h1`) for each page in a set of documents and only use a level-1 heading once on a page.

Avoid repeating the exact page title in a heading on the page. For example, if you document how to create a virtual machine and how to start a virtual machine on the same task-based page, the page title might be _Create and start VM instances_, with section headings _Create a VM_ and _Start a VM_.

### Mixed heading styles

It's OK to use task-based and conceptual heading styles in the same document. If a single document includes both task-based and conceptual sections, then use the appropriate phrasing for each section's heading.

### Use of _-ing_ verb forms

When possible, avoid using _-ing_ verb forms as the first word in any heading or title.

| Recommended | Not recommended |
|---|---|
| Transfer data sets | Transferring data sets |

An _-ing_ verb form is a present participle or gerund. These verb forms are inconsistently translated when they're used as the first word in a title, and they increase character count in limited spaces.

Sometimes, there might not be a better alternative to using a gerund, such as the following examples:

- Billing
- Pricing

It's OK to use a gerund in these cases.

It's OK to use an _-ing_ verb form later in a heading or title, such as _Introduction to BigQuery monitoring_.

### Example headings

The following example is a task-based document that includes a conceptual heading and a task-based heading.

Recommended:

HTML:

```html
<h1>Log serving requests by using AI Platform Prediction</h1>

<p>This task-based document shows how to monitor machine learning models. The
document title starts with a bare infinitive.</p>

<h2>ML model monitoring overview</h2>

<p>This section provides a conceptual overview of ML model monitoring. Its title is
a noun phrase.</p>

<h2>Configure notebook settings<h2>

<p>This task-based section provides a series of steps to set variables in a
notebook. Its title starts with a bare infinitive.</p>
```

document title starts with a bare infinitive.

## ML model monitoring overview

a noun phrase.

## Configure notebook settings

## Heading and title format

The following sections list and define our writing standards for capitalization, abbreviations, and technical elements in headings. In general, guidance that applies to standard text also applies to headings—for example, contractions and articles.

### Syntax and capitalization

- **Use sentence case** for all headings and titles. For more information, see Capitalization in titles and headings.
- **Keep punctuation simple**. Punctuation can be a sign that your heading is too complicated. Consider rewriting.
- **Limit abbreviations**. Only use an abbreviation of a word in a page title or heading if it's the more commonly known version of the word. If you do so, define the abbreviation in the first instance of the word in a paragraph. You can define the abbreviation in the page title or heading, but consider if the additional length adds value. For SEO, use the more prominent version of a term in headings. For more information, see Abbreviations.

### Formatting and code

- **Don't use numbers in headings** to indicate a sequence of sections. Instead, rely on heading hierarchy and order to indicate sequence.
- **Avoid code items in headings**. If you must mention a code item in a heading, add a descriptive noun to the item in code font. For more information, see Grammatical treatment of code elements.
- **Don't put links in headings**. A link can easily be confused as a style applied to the heading instead of a link.

### Hierarchy and structure

- **Don't use heading tags to change visual formatting**. Use CSS rather than a heading level that doesn't fit the hierarchy. Don't make up your own formatting for headings.
- **Apply proper heading tags**. Use heading tags to structure your content hierarchically—for example, `<h1>`, `<h2>`, and `<h3>` in HTML, or `#`, `##`, and `###` in Markdown.
- **Maintain logical order**. Don't skip levels of the heading hierarchy. For example, put an `<h3>` tag only under an `<h2>` tag.

## Refer to a group of sections

If you introduce a group of related H3 or lower sections within a larger H2 section, use the phrase _the following sections_. Don't refer to the group of sections using the phrases _this section_ or _these sections_ because those phrases are ambiguous.
