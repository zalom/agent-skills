Put a nonbreaking space (`&nbsp;`) between the number and the unit.

## Spaces in units of measurement

For most units of measurement, when you specify a number with the unit, use a nonbreaking space between the number and the unit. This guidance applies in both HTML and Markdown.

For guidance about when to spell out units, see the Abbreviations page.

For guidance about whether to hyphenate, see the Hyphens page.

Recommended: `64&nbsp;GB` (64 GB)

Recommended: `25&nbsp;mm` (25 mm)

Recommended: a 128-bit system

Not recommended: `64 GB` (with a regular breaking space)

Not recommended: 64GB

For more information about making abbreviations plural, see Plural abbreviations on the Pluralization page.

However, when the unit of measure is money or percent or degrees of an angle, don't use a space. For more information, see Currency.

Recommended: $10

Recommended: £25

Recommended: 65%

Recommended: 180°

For degrees of temperature, include a nonbreaking space between the number and the degree symbol. Don't use a space between the degree symbol (`&deg;`) and the temperature scale (_F_ or _C_).

Example: 50 °C

HTML: `50&nbsp;&deg;C`

Markdown: `50&nbsp;&deg;C`

For Kelvin temperatures, leave out the degree symbol but use a nonbreaking space before the _K_.

Example: 300 K

HTML: `300&nbsp;K`

Markdown: `300&nbsp;K`

When a number and unit of measurement combine to modify a noun, don't hyphenate unless the hyphen is needed for clarity.

Recommended: `200&nbsp;GB disk` (200 GB disk)

## Ranges of numbers with units

In a range of numbers, repeat the unit for each number. _Unit_ includes both symbols (like the degree symbol (º)) and abbreviations (like _MB_ for megabytes) but not nouns (like _file_). For more information, see Range of numbers on the Hyphens page.

Use the word _to_ between the numbers, rather than a hyphen. A hyphen can be misinterpreted as a subtraction sign.

Recommended: -40 °C to 85 °C

Not recommended: -40-85 °C

## Hyphens with multiplied units

When the components of a unit of measurement are multiplied by each other, hyphenate them.

## Use _k_ to indicate thousands

In some contexts, it might be appropriate to indicate thousands of something by following a number with a lowercase _k_. If you do that, then follow these guidelines:

- Don't put a space between the number and _k_.
- Add a noun to indicate what the number measures, and to make clear that you're not using _k_ as an abbreviation for _kilobytes_.

## Currency

If you're writing about monetary amounts, make sure that the reader knows what currency you're referring to. For example, the dollar sign—the _$_ symbol—can refer to US dollars, Canadian dollars, Mexican pesos, and several other currencies.

If there's any possibility of ambiguity, use a currency indicator before the amount. For details, see section 9.20 and following in the Chicago Manual of Style, 17th edition.

Recommended: US$10

## Rates

Use _per_ instead of the division slash (/) when space permits. It's OK to use the division slash when space is limited, such as in a table with small cells.

Shorten _per_ to _p_ only for well-established abbreviations for rate units, such as _Gbps_ for _gigabits per second_ or _MBps_ for _megabytes per second_.

Recommended: requests per day

Not recommended: requests/day

Recommended: Gbps

Not recommended: Gb/s

## Decimal and binary units

Use the same system to measure bytes as the technology that you're documenting. Don't use _MB_ if you mean _MiB_, or _GB_ if you mean _GiB_. The following table lists common types of decimal and binary units:

| Decimal units | Binary units |
|---|---|
| kB (kilobyte, or 1000 bytes) | KiB (kibibyte, or 1024 bytes) |
| MB (megabyte, or 1000<sup>2</sup> bytes) | MiB (mebibyte, or 1024<sup>2</sup> bytes) |
| GB (gigabyte, or 1000<sup>3</sup> bytes) | GiB (gibibyte, or 1024<sup>3</sup> bytes) |
